## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

If this application is in response to an RFP, please indicate this on the first line of this section.

### Background and why we are building this
Currently, there is no way people issue certificates or badges or credentials easily on-chain, in web2 there are a couple of credential issuing platforms like Accredible. 
What is new is that on-chain, you can not only issue but also verify these credentials in a permission-less and trust-less manner, so for instance imagine LinkedIn being able to verify you actually went to Harvard after you put it up in your profile. 
With the emergence of NFTs, one of the ways to ensure longevity is utility, and having credentials like badges in the metaverse as NFTs is exactly what the future should look like.


### Project Details: Testnet Link

[Accred: NFT credentials on the blockchain.](https://testnet.daccred.co)

Our platform enables individuals to design and issue and manage credentials that are verifiable on-chain as NFTs, and these credentials can be issues from institutions, DAOs and events or workshops

### Use cases
- For Certified Membership in a DAO
- For Certified membership in a Community
- For Certification of acquiring knowledge in an institution
- Certification of association in an event, workshop, hackathon
- Certified accreditation
- Integrate our API and use on your platform [*Roadmap Feature]

### Ecosystem Fit

Help us locate your project in the Polkadot/Substrate/Kusama landscape and what problems it tries to solve by answering each of these questions:

- Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?
- Who is your target audience (parachain/dapp/wallet/UI developers, designers, your own user base, some dapp's userbase, yourself)?
- What need(s) does your project meet?
- Are there any other projects similar to yours in the Substrate / Polkadot / Kusama ecosystem?
  - If so, how is your project different?
  - If not, are there similar projects in related ecosystems?

### Team's experience

We are web3 enthusiasts, both reading and finding out more things about the future of the web. Andrew has been building a few projects and doing a couple of experiments in the web3 space, Last year, he built a POC Defi Asset Tracker that keeps tabs on all your tokens on ETH, Polygon, and BSC chains, which got featured on East Africa's largest Crypto News [https://bitcoinke.io/2021/07/introducing-defisset-com/] 

He has also written and deployed smart contracts for DeFi platforms that holds over $5,000,000 in Total Value Locked, one of which is AlgoVest [https://etherscan.io/tx/0xcf9de025b2e0d0f8693cceaba6b553081b5edfdd77d659beec0c6e3c17a0618f] and a couple other Web3 focused initiatives. I have over 3 years experience managing communities and handling operations for SAAS products like Accred.

## Development Status :open_book:

If you've already started implementing your project or it is part of a larger repository, please provide a link and a description of the code here. In any case, please provide some documentation on the research and other work you have conducted before applying. This could be:


- We have now successfully integrated with Harmony Testnet. You can check it out here https://testnet.daccred.co

- This is the Harmony Smart contract on Testnet Harmony Blockchain Explorer https://explorer.testnet.harmony.one/address/one16vef3x4fzyz9h4xptsa400hcp5qlf45ek3qnpc

- Our brand guidelines and focus on user experience is also getting evident https://daccred.co

- On Marketing: We have created a Twitter account https://twitter.com/daccred and now have a Twitter Revue Newsletter Web3 and Blockchain Trends by Accred | Revue where we have started intensive content marketing to educate community members. Please do well to follow us https://twitter.com/daccred and spread the word.

- On Community: we have created a Discord https://discord.gg/P83HNYC7 and would soon start using it for all community-related correspondence.



## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt:

This section should break the development roadmap down into milestones and deliverables. To assist you in defining it, we have created a document with examples for some grant categories [here](../docs/grant_guidelines_per_category.md). Since these will be part of the agreement, it helps to describe _the functionality we should expect in as much detail as possible_, plus how we can verify and test that functionality. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to this document to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.

Below we provide an **example roadmap**. In the descriptions, it should be clear how your project is related to Substrate, Kusama or Polkadot. We _recommend_ that teams structure their roadmap as 1 milestone ≈ 1 month.

For each milestone,

- make sure to include a specification of your software. _Treat it as a contract_; the level of detail must be enough to later verify that the software meets the specification.
- include the amount of funding requested _per milestone_.
- include documentation (tutorials, API specifications, architecture diagrams, whatever is appropriate) in each milestone. This ensures that the code can be widely used by the community.
- provide a test suite, comprising unit and integration tests, along with a guide on how to set up and run them.
- commit to providing Dockerfiles for the delivery of your project.
- indicate milestone duration as well as number of full-time employees working on each milestone.
- **Deliverables 0a-0d are mandatory for all milestones**, and deliverable 0e at least for the last one. If you do not intend to deliver one of these, please state a reason in its specification (e.g. Milestone X is research oriented and as such there is no code to test).

> :zap: If any of your deliverables is based on somebody else's work, make sure you work and publish _under the terms of the license_ of the respective project and that you **highlight this fact in your milestone documentation** and in the source code if applicable! **Teams that submit others' work without attributing it will be immediately terminated.**

### Overview

- **Total Estimated Duration:** Duration of the whole project (e.g. 2 months)
- **Full-Time Equivalent (FTE):**  Average number of full-time employees working on the project throughout its duration (see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full-time_equivalent), e.g. 2 FTE)
- **Total Costs:** Requested amount in USD for the whole project (e.g. 12,000 USD). Note that the acceptance criteria and additional benefits vary depending on the [level](../README.md#level_slider-levels) of funding requested. This and the costs for each milestone need to be provided in USD; if the grant is paid out in Bitcoin, the amount will be calculated according to the exchange rate at the time of payment.

### Milestone 1 Example — Implement Substrate Modules

- **Estimated duration:** 1 month
- **FTE:**  2

## Future Plans

In the coming weeks, we are looking to do a number of things such as

- Grow the Daccred Community with Educators, Creators, and Professionals looking to issue Credentials on low cost, fast, and environmental friendly blockchain networks
- Build out the Credentials claims page templates
- Support more variables in Designs
- Build out the dashboard
- Do more integrations for recipients and waitlists.
